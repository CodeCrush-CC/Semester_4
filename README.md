This repository contains codes/program for semester-4.

## hdf
The list to the questions of the programs is given in the repository in form of Pdf named as " DIRECTORY ", instead of downloading the whole repository, one can check for the desired code and can download the required program as per need.

All programs are error free and are compiled and then executed in MS-Dos Box version-0.74 on Windows.

I don't make recommendations; that would be too much like taking sides in commercial wars. Also, I don't know every C++ compiler; there are simply too many "out there".It is not neccesary to use DosBox/Turbo C++ compiler, one can choose the compiler of their own interest such as Code Blocks, Atom, Visual studio, Dev C++, Xcode(Mac), Clang(linux)
